## Dense Layer vs 1x1 Convolution – Complete Notes

### 🧠 Dense Layer (Fully Connected Layer)

#### 🔹 Definition:

A dense layer is a fully connected layer where every input neuron is connected to every output neuron.

#### 🔹 Formula:

$$
y = Wx + b
$$

* $x$: Input vector
* $W$: Weight matrix
* $b$: Bias vector
* $y$: Output vector

#### 🔹 Use Cases:

* Used at the end of CNN for classification.
* Helps in creating complex decision boundaries.
* Outputs logits or probabilities for prediction.

### 🔹 1x1 Convolution

#### 💡 What is 1x1 Convolution?

A 1x1 convolution is a special case of convolution where the kernel size is 1×1. It processes **each spatial location (pixel) independently across all channels**.

#### 📐 Input & Output Shape:

* **Input:** $H \times W \times C_{in}$
* **Filter:** 1×1×$C_{in}$ (depth same as input channels)
* **Output:** $H \times W \times C_{out}$

#### 🔢 Mathematical Operation:

$$
Output(i, j, k) = \sum_{c=1}^{C_{in}} W_{1,1,c,k} \cdot Input(i, j, c) + b_k
$$

* Applies a per-pixel weighted sum across all channels.

### 🔁 Flashcard Q\&A

**Q1. What does a 1×1 convolution do?**
A. Applies a fully connected layer across channels at every pixel location.

**Q2. How does 1×1 conv help in model design?**
A. Reduces channels, adds non-linearity, and mixes features.

**Q3. Is spatial info preserved in 1×1 conv?**
A. Yes, spatial structure (H×W) is preserved.
