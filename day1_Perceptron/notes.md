### ‚ùì What is the **discriminant** in a quadratic equation?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
Discriminant is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root:  
\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]  
It helps determine the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).  

---

### ‚ùì What does the `hue` parameter do in a **scatter plot** (e.g., in seaborn)?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
The `hue` parameter adds **color-based grouping** to a scatter plot based on a categorical column. It helps to visually distinguish **different classes or categories** in the same plot.

---

### ‚ùì What does `x = df.iloc[:, 0:2]` do?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
This selects **all rows** and **columns 0 and 1** (first two columns) from the DataFrame `df` using **integer-location based indexing** (`iloc`), and stores it in variable `x`.

---
### ‚ùì What does `p = Perceptron()` do?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
It creates a **Perceptron classifier object** named `p` from `sklearn.linear_model`. The model is not yet trained ‚Äî it's just initialized with default parameters.

---

### ‚ùì What does `p.fit(x, y)` do in Perceptron?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
It **trains the Perceptron model** `p` using input features `x` and labels `y`. The model adjusts its internal weights using the Perceptron learning rule until it can classify the inputs.

---

### ‚ùì What is `p.coef_` in Perceptron?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
`p.coef_` stores the **learned weight vector** for each feature after training.  
It is used in the decision function:
\[
\text{sign}(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n + b)
\]  
It tells how important each feature is for classification.

---

### ‚ùì How are Perceptron weights (`p.coef_`) calculated?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
Perceptron uses the update rule:
\[
w = w + \eta \cdot (y_i - \hat{y}_i) \cdot x_i
\]  
\[
b = b + \eta \cdot (y_i - \hat{y}_i)
\]  
- Initially weights are 0.  
- They are updated **only when prediction is wrong**.  
- This process is repeated for all data points until convergence or max_iter is reached.

---

### ‚ùì What does `from mlxtend.plotting import plot_decision_regions` do?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
It imports the function `plot_decision_regions` from the `mlxtend.plotting` module, which is used to **visualize the decision boundaries** of a trained classifier on a **2D feature space**.

---

### ‚ùì How does `plot_decision_regions(X=X, y=y, clf=model)` work?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
It plots the **decision regions** of a classifier (`clf`) based on features `X` and labels `y`.  
- Fills regions with different colors based on predicted classes.  
- Plots actual data points for comparison.  
- Only works when `X` has **2 features**.

---

### ‚ùì What is required for using `plot_decision_regions`?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
- A trained classifier (`clf`)  
- 2D input features (`X` must have exactly 2 columns)  
- Target labels (`y`)  
- `mlxtend` library must be installed (`pip install mlxtend`)

### ‚ùì Why is the **discriminant** important in machine learning (beyond quadratic equations)?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
Though the discriminant is mainly used in quadratic equations, the idea of a **discriminating factor** translates into ML when defining **decision boundaries** ‚Äî e.g., in SVMs and LDA, where the aim is to maximize class separability. In that context, it's a conceptual analogy to identifying **how clearly two classes can be separated.**

---

### ‚ùì What happens internally in `Perceptron.fit()`? Explain the algorithm.

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
The `.fit()` method implements the **Perceptron Learning Algorithm**:
1. Initialize weights and bias to 0.
2. For every data point:
   - Compute output:  
     \[
     \hat{y} = \text{sign}(w \cdot x + b)
     \]
   - If prediction is wrong:  
     \[
     w = w + \eta (y - \hat{y}) x
     \quad,\quad
     b = b + \eta (y - \hat{y})
     \]
3. Repeat for multiple iterations (epochs) or until convergence.

The algorithm updates weights **only on misclassified points** and does **not minimize a loss function** like modern algorithms.

---

### ‚ùì Can the Perceptron algorithm solve non-linearly separable problems?

**‚úÖ Answer:** 
‚ùå No.  
Perceptron only works for **linearly separable** problems.  
For non-linear problems, it **never converges** ‚Äî it keeps updating weights forever.  
(For such tasks, we need MLP, SVM with kernels, or other non-linear models.)

---

### ‚ùì What is the **geometrical meaning** of `p.coef_` and `p.intercept_`?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
- `p.coef_` is the **normal vector** to the decision hyperplane. It defines the **orientation (tilt)** of the decision boundary.
- `p.intercept_` is the **bias** or **offset** ‚Äî it shifts the boundary up/down or left/right.

The decision boundary equation becomes:
\[
w \cdot x + b = 0
\]

---

### ‚ùì What is the role of the **sign function** in the Perceptron algorithm?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
The sign function:
\[
\text{sign}(z) = 
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } z \geq 0 \\
-1 & \text{if } z < 0
\end{cases}
\]

- It acts as a **threshold function**.
- If the linear combination of inputs is positive, it predicts one class; otherwise, it predicts another.
- It makes the model **non-differentiable**, which is why gradient descent isn‚Äôt used here.

---
### ‚ùì How does `plot_decision_regions()` know how to color regions?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
- It creates a **mesh grid** over the 2D feature space.
- For each point on the grid, it uses the classifier (`clf`) to **predict the class**.
- Based on the predicted class, it fills that region with a unique color using `matplotlib.contourf()`.

---

### ‚ùì Why can't `plot_decision_regions` work with more than 2 features?

**‚úÖ Answer:**  
Because it plots in **2D space** only.  
With more than 2 features, it‚Äôs not possible to visualize all dimensions on a 2D plot.  
You need to use **dimensionality reduction** (like PCA or t-SNE) before using `plot_decision_regions` with high-dimensional data.

---

### ‚ùì What are the differences between **Perceptron and Logistic Regression**?

| Aspect | Perceptron | Logistic Regression |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Output | +1 / -1 (binary class) | Probability (0 to 1) |
| Learning | Rule-based (hard threshold) | Gradient Descent (log loss) |
| Decision Function | sign(w¬∑x + b) | sigmoid(w¬∑x + b) |
| Convergence | Only for linearly separable data | Works on both linear and non-linear |
| Loss Function | None | Log Loss (cross-entropy) |

---

### ‚ùì What is the difference between `p.predict()` and `p.decision_function()`?

**‚úÖ Answer:**
- `p.predict()` returns the final class label (+1 or 0).
- `p.decision_function()` returns the **raw score** (i.e., \( w \cdot x + b \)) before applying the sign function.  
Useful for threshold tuning or understanding margin distances.
---

### ‚ùì What are the limitations of the Perceptron algorithm?

**‚úÖ Answer:**
- Works only for **linearly separable data**.
- No loss function ‚Äî can‚Äôt be optimized with gradient descent.
- Doesn‚Äôt give probabilities.
- Can be unstable for overlapping data.
- Not suitable for complex decision boundaries.
