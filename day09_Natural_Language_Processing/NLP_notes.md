### ðŸ“– Flashcards

```
Q: What is NLP?
A: A field of AI that enables machines to understand and process human language.

Q: What is tokenization?
A: Splitting a sentence into words or tokens.

Q: What is stemming?
A: Reducing words to their base/root form (e.g., 'running' â†’ 'run').

Q: What is TF-IDF?
A: A method to weigh words based on importance in a document and rarity across all documents.

Q: Which model introduced self-attention?
A: Transformer.

Q: What's the difference between stemming and lemmatization?
A: Stemming is rule-based; lemmatization is dictionary-based and more accurate.
